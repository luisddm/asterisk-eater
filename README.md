This is a simple game (well, still not even a game, but a wannabe game!) to show how fast can a prototype of a board game be developed with AngularJS.

Thanks to the **two-way data binding** (the magic of AngularJS) we can manipulate the cells of the board in the controller while their current status will be reflected immediately on the view.
